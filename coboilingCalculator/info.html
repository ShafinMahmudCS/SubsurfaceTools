            <p>
                This website provides a calculator to predict the co-boiling point of groundwater contaminants under
                various subsurface conditions. This tool is designed to provide a method for estimating the co-boiling
                point without the need for extensive calculations or in simulating the whole system.
            </p>
            <p><b>Co-Boiling point: </b>The temperature at which an aqueous compound dissolved in water
                will volatilize and could possibly be removed from the subsurface. Temperature depends on many
                parameters including, contaminant type, soil type, and depth of contaminant.</p>
            <p>
                To use the cBPC, enter values for each parameter for the soil and contaminant in the system.
                Values can be entered manually or selected from the provided database. For more information on each
                parameter or the database see below.
                <br><b>The cBPC makes some assumptions:</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>1. Initial mass of contaminant in system is calculated at 20°C ; therefore all parameters are
                    taken at 20°C, except the Henry’s coefficient which changes with temperature.</li>
                <li>2. Soils and contaminants are assumed to be homogeneous in nature, contaminants are assumed to be
                    dissolved in water.</li>
                <li>3. Gas formation is assumed to occur when gas saturation exceeds 0.01.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="content-subhead" ><a id="parameters">Contaminant Parameters</h2>
            <p><b>Molecular Weight (g/mol): </b>The molecular weight of the compound.</p>
            <p><b>Solubility Limit (mg/L): </b>The maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent at a
                specified temperature and pressure is its solubility. This value is taken at 20°C, and is used to
                simulate conditions before heat is introduced into the system.</p>
            <p><b>Henry’s Coefficient: </b> Henry’s coefficient is the ratio between the aqueous phase concentration
                and the gas phase concentration. For the cBPC, it is assumed to be temperature dependant and a linear
                regression model in the form of <img src="./resources/equation_H.png"> was used. [1] Discrete data can be obtained from
                the EPA online tool <a class="links" href="https://www3.epa.gov/ceampubl/learn2model/part-two/onsite/esthenry.html" target="_blank">here</a>,
                 which uses two different methods to calculate H based on temperature.
                These discrete calculations are based on experimental results and are only accurate within a temperature
                range same as the values obtained from the above paper [1]. Therefore these values may not be as
                accurate at really high temperatures, see below.</p>
            <h2 class="content-subhead">Soil Parameters</h2>
            <p><b>Residual Water Saturation: </b>The amount of water in a soil system after the displacement pressure
                had removed all excess water from the system. This is sometimes referred to the irreducible water
                saturation and represents water that is trapped in the smallest (or not connected) pores.  is
                represented as a fraction of the total water saturation (or one) minus the initial water saturation .</p>
            <p><b>Displacement Pressure (Pa): </b>The pressure at which water first enters the soil by overcoming
                capillary pressure is defined the displacement pressure (Pd). Determined experimentally. </p>
            <p><b>Pore Size index (λ): </b>relative abundance of each pore size in a representative volume of soil.
                It can be represented as a value proportional to the volume of pores whose effective radius is
                within a range centered any given position. The pore size index is part of the Brooks-Corey
                relationships for defining the relationship between saturation and capillary pressure.</p>
            <p><b>Porosity (n): </b>a measure of the total amount of empty space or voids in soil.
                Represented as a fraction of the total volume between 0 and 1 or 0% and 100%. </p>
            <h2 class="content-subhead" ><a id="database"> Database</h2>
            <p>
                The database is a collection of known soil and contaminant parameters.
                The contaminants are separated by contaminant type and defined by the <a class="links" href="https://frtr.gov/matrix2/section2/2_intro.html" target="_blank">
                FRTR screening Matrix and reference guide</a>. Molecular weight and solubility limit were obtained from
                the <a class="links" href="https://www.ilo.org/safework/info/publications/WCMS_113134/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">
                ILO International Chemical Safety Cards</a>. Henry’s Coefficient values were obtained from the
                <a class="links" href="https://www3.epa.gov/ceampubl/learn2model/part-two/onsite/esthenry.html" target="_blank">EPA.</a> tool or
                the paper [1]. Soil parameters were obtained from published papers which collected experimental data from different soils.
                Soils are sorted by type and porosity therefore a soil closest in, porosity, Pd, Lambda and sr should be selected from
                the database. If specific parameters, that are not in the database, are known they can be used in the cBPC.

            <p>
                In order to determine the co-boiling point of the given system the calculator first calculates the
                expected mass of contaminant in system based on solubility, molecular weight, and porosity. With that you
                can then make a guess of what the temperature should be and see if the expected mass matches at that
                temperature based on the other parameters. The calculator does this using a binary search algorithm to find the
                correct temperature which then gets rounded to the nearest whole value to account for any rounding or
                precision error. The calculations are done using some equations such as the Brooks-Corey equation for
                capillary pressure, Henry's Law, Dalton's Law, and the ideal gas law. [2] <br><br>The calculator can sometimes
                fail to find a solution for the system if one doesn't exist or if it falls out of the expected bounds, most
                real systems however should have a solution. The method of determining Henry's coefficient may also lead
                to some inaccuracy at higher temperatures. For more information on the calculations and background research see
